timeout-dialog.js
=================

Timeout-dialog.js is a plugin that displays a timeout popover after a certain period of time. The timeout dialog should be used whenever you want to display to the user that the logged in session is about to expire. It creates a light box with a countdown and options to stay signed in or sign out.
